Play it so safe to stay on top. Shake it, imitate it, but it still sounds old. 
We just can't understand why the man calls it lo-fi. 
So get your bags packed now and I'll meet you on the outside.
"X"-out all self-supervision...get your keys out, now start the ignition.
We're on the verge of...All right!
When you're shipwrecked on your mattress I'll come in and show you how to hijack the past and
wind up in the right now. 
Grag some clothes, three chords and a video camera. 
Maybe a mic, some handwipes, a typewriter, and a hammer.
Why don't you come over now?
I'll buzz you up.
'Cause you know when you're around I can't get enough. 
I'm gonna follow you, wait, straight into the late night. 
'Cause you're so on fire and you already know. 
A-O-A-O do it so right
A-O-A-O do it tonight
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo. 
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo. 
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo.
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo.
If you ask us how we want it, we'll say man-to-man. When you go to kiss our cheeks we're gonna
put out our hands because (all night!) we've been talking to liars. And it's (all right!) just
not in the style of tigers.

And if you ask us what we're doing we'll say, "It doesn't matter to you". All you need to know
is we love to see the crowd move.

So turn it up! It really isn't loud enough. When we say when, we know you'll think it's too
much. 

So what?
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo. 
So what?
It's just a joke, man, it's just an interview.
So what?
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo.
So what?
You'll never get it, I guess this shit is too new.

Now let's synchronize our movements ‘til they're super sick. We got high hats and loud claps in
every mix.. We're like boys, just ask her, dicks done by C.P. Caster. Hey, look out, you're still
in slip mode! Thanks, but now I'm in batch capture.

And if you ask us why we're laughing we'll say, "It doesn't matter to you". All you need to know
is we love to see the crowd move. 

So turn it up! It really isn't loud enough. When we say when, we know you'll think it's too much.

So what?
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo.

It's just a joke, man, it's just an interview.

Headphones and velcro and pictures of Mars.
(So what?)
New mics and dirt bikes and candy bars.
(So what?)
Bowties and sneakers while making beats
(So what?)
Hard-drives and handbooks and hotel sheets
So What?
It doesn't matter to you.
So What?
It doesn't matter to you.
So What?
It doesn't matter to you.
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo.
So what?
I do it every night.
She does it in her man suit.
So what?
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo.
So what?
We never said it; you know we always wanted to
So what..
So what?
So what?
So What?
Nanny nanny, nanny nanny boo boo. 
So what?
It's just a joke, man, it's just an interview.

We learned this lesson five times fine: fake left, go right, back-stabs read minds! 
Taillights shine beautiful, they make halos on the road. 
Don't give our keys to the city to shark-suits, b-sides, free-things-please!
I left the code at the coat-check pointed to the word on my neck. 
That's me, all night on stand-by.
Three words, three things...oh please please!
Don't, don't drink poison! 
Wolf Girl, poolside, I'm in the lobby.
Gay concierge-spy high fives me. 
It's all cool enemy style, smile at the tv while you download her file. 
Watch for the quick slip, money shot, vid clip. 
Walk past slowly, pass me the nurse kit. 
Don't be fooled by the sister vocab...keep it light, put it on her tab.
Heads up for this tonight...it's some you'll recognize.
Looks like lips and feels like teeth, always waving to the people from the magazine. 
There's one thing they love to see...it's tear jearks for charity and blank smirks all the way
to the airport. 
There's one drink, on ice, oh I think it's ...
They say trouble comes in threes, I say Chicken Ceasar grows on trees. 
It could be lucky to be out of luck. 
I mean, better than to take the test where amnesiacs must write on napkins.
Prepare for what might happen.
In a trance from polished talk we think...coat throat, lemon lime, hot choc, oh! ...
Fem Exec is right behind me. 
Almost there, through the glass doors, against the wall, on the third floor.
We found a robot hand hidden in a potted plant. 
And we're not too nice to notice when white wine stinks and we're misquoted.
Want more real attention. At my expense guess you forgot to mention. You talk good, I'll eat
glass. I heard you read my mind behind my back.
Outside, I’m waitin', by the car when you’re hesitatin'.

Take a good look.
Take a photo.
Write about it in your tiny notebook.

Don’t you know? You’re out cold.
Don’t you know? It’s our dance-floor!

T.K.O.
Hear it on the radio.
T.K.O.
Play it on the stereo.
T.K.O.
Watch a live video.

T.K.O.
T.K.O.
Oh, oh..
Oh, oh..

Got your money safe. Wanna be in. Everyday it just gets closer to you. I’ll say my piece. And
when it’s over, you’ll be on your knees, I.. got this soul thing on the go. Read about it at your
Barnes & Noble.

Don’t you know? It’s our dance-floor!

T.K.O.
Hear it on the radio.
T.K.O.
Play it on the stereo.
T.K.O.
Watch a live video.
T.K.O.
TKO-O-O.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

Night is young. And we all know what’s up. The ocean calls us away from..

Don’t you know? It’s our dance-floor

Oh, oh..
Oh, oh..

T.K.O.
Hear it on the radio.
T.K.O.
Play it on your stereo.
T.K.O.
Watch a live video.
